We suppose that you will have a specific working directory, and you will put all the project files on the same folder
 that we will name "./" throughout this guide.
An asterisk "*" is placed in front of procedures that you have to do.

I) Download:
* Download the data that are present in either:
	1- Under the ID d001 in:  		http://predict.cs.unm.edu/downloads.php
	2- Or directly in (if not down):		https://unmm-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jcavanagh_unm_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fjcavanagh%5Funm%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FPD%20Oddball%20Data&ga=1
* Once the data are downloaded they should be placed in a sub-folder named <data> on your working directory.
    /!\ the folders names should be respected as they are case sensitive.


II) Folder creation:
* Create the following folders in the working directory "./":
    1- EEGLAB
    2- generated SDF
    3- generated SDF backup
    4- figures
    5- test memory
* Create two folders inside the folder "./data" named:
    1- info
    2- processed
* Inside the folder "./data/info" place the file that you can find from git: <subject_info.json>
After these steps you should have the following directory tree:

./ (working directory)
├── all code (*.py)
|
├── EEGLAB
├── extracted features
├── generated features
├── generated features backup
├── figures
└── data
    ├── processed
    ├── info
    |   └── subject_info.json
    |
    ├── 804_1_PDDys_ODDBALL.mat
    ├── 804_2_PDDys_ODDBALL.mat
    |            .
    |            .
    |            .
    └── 8070_1_PDDys_ODDBALL.mat


III) EEG-lab download:
Since we already analysed the ICAs during my internship using EEG-lab and the ICs are already calculated by James
 Cavanagh's team plus we already identified those containing ocular activity we kept this part using MATLAB to not redo
 the work. Thus, it is mandatory for this part to remove the ICs containing ocular activity using EEG-lab version 14.
    - If you want to redo the ICA analysis, you can skip this step and "Step 2 - ICA removal and preparation" however
      there is some modifications to do, see what "Step 2 - ICA removal and preparation" for more details
      (mainly you have to be careful about this part "find(tx==t_min+450);  ST_t2 = find(tx==t_max+450); % indexes for
      Std & Target stimuli" since there is a shift due to some delay). It is preferable to follow the script.
 * Once the files are downloaded they should be decompressed and put in the foldter "./EEGLAB"
